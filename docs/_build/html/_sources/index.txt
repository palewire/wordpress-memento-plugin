wordpress-memento-plugin
========================

A plugin for Wordpress web sites to enable the Memento framework for time-based access


What is Memento?
----------------

Memento is a `HTTP-based framework <http://mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/>`_
that "bridges the past and present web." Sites that support it — like the
Internet Archive and the Library of Congress — accept time-based web requests
and return past versions of archived URLs.

What does this plugin do?
-------------------------

Rather than rely on patchy third-party services for preservation, sites with
this plugin installed instantly become their own living, digital archive.

Past revisions of posts, inaccessible to users of a typical Wordpress site,
are indexed and available for review.

Once installed, this package will instantly upgrade a Wordpress site to
support `the Memento system <http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/quick-intro/>`_ by:

* Creating a new URL for past revisions of each post stored in the Wordpress database, so archived versions are surfaced online
* Publishing a `"TimeMap" <http://mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/#Pattern6>`_ that lists all of the revision URLs for each post in your archive, so spiders can find and index archived revisions
* Hosting a `"TimeGate" <http://mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/#component-1.2>`_ that handles requests that include a URL and a timestamp by redirecting to the nearest revision, so browsers and other apps can "time travel" on your site
* Enriching post and revision URLs to include extra metadata required by the Memento system, so archived pages can be connected to each other
